#### FortiSOAR Content Hub & Connectors

Content Hub is a vital component of FortiSOAR that provides a centralized repository of pre-built playbooks, scripts, and integrations. It serves as a knowledge base and resource center for security operations, allowing teams to leverage existing content and collaborate effectively.

Content Hub offers a vast collection of pre-defined playbooks created by Fortinet's experts and the broader cybersecurity community. These playbooks cover a wide range of use cases, including incident response, threat hunting, vulnerability management, and compliance. By utilizing these pre-built playbooks, security teams can accelerate their response times and ensure consistency in their incident handling processes.

In addition to playbooks, Content Hub provides access to a variety of integration connectors. These connectors allow FortiSOAR to connect and interact with different security tools, such as FortiWeb and FortiClient EMS, as well as third-party solutions. This seamless integration capability ensures that incidents and alarms from various sources can be ingested, analyzed, and responded to from a single platform.

Furthermore, Content Hub enables collaboration and knowledge sharing among security professionals. It allows users to contribute their playbooks, scripts, and integrations to the community, fostering a vibrant ecosystem of security automation. This collaborative approach encourages the exchange of best practices and empowers security teams to continually improve their incident response capabilities.

More Information can be found in the [FortiSOAR User Guide - Content Hub](http://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortisoar/7.4.1/user-guide/667127/content-hub)

### Setup FortiAnalyzer Data Ingestion

Connectors in FortiSOAR can be used to tak action or to ingest Data into FortiSOAR like Assets, Events or Indicators, etc. Some Connectors, for example the FortiAnalyzer Connector allow to Ingest Data & take actions like `Run Report`, `LIST LOG FIELDS`, etc. These actions can be used within a playbook to "do something". We will have a closer Look into Playbooks and how Connectors can be used in the next Chapter.

- To view the predefined actions of a Connector, select the `Actions & Playbooks` Tab after you have selected a Connector
![image-20230704123319431](../assets/image-20230704123319431.png)

To Configure the Data Ingestion of FortiAnalyzer, for example to feed Events generated by FortiClient EMS into FortiSOAR, take the following steps:

1. In the FortiSOAR menu sidebar, goto `Content Hub`, select the `Manage`Tab
![image-20230704124704695](../assets/image-20230704124704695.png)

2. In the Searchbar type `FortiAnalyzer`
![image-20230704124749201](../assets/image-20230704124749201.png)

3. Select the FortiAnalyzer Connector, and click on `Configure Data Ingestion` at the right side of the Window
![Screenshot 2023-07-04 at 12.49.02]("../assets/Screenshot 2023-07-04 at 12.49.02.png")

4. A new Overlay Popup will appear. Click on `Let's start by fetching some data` to start the configuration process
![image-20230704125148880](../assets/image-20230704125148880.png)

5. To configure field mappings with example data, adjust the default value as shown below and continue by clicking on `FETCH DATA` at the bottom right corner
![image-20230704125516762](../assets/image-20230704125516762.png)

7. In this lab, we will manually trigger the ingestion as the Lab is using an unlicensed version of FortiSOAR. This is limited to 300 Actions per day which also includes Data ingestion. In an production environment, a Schedule would be configured to automtically ingest the data and add the alerts to FortiSOAR.
